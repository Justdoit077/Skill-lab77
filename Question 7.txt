# 1)A set is a collection of distinct elements, where each element is unique within the set. 
# In other words, a set contains only unique elements, and no two elements in a set can be identical.

# 2)Sets in most programming languages are mutable, meaning you can add or remove elements from them after they've been created. 
# This mutability allows for operations like adding or removing elements, which would not be possible if sets were immutable.

set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}

# Union
union_set = set1.union(set2)
print(union_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

# Intersection
intersection_set = set1.intersection(set2)
print(intersection_set)  # Output: {3, 4}

# Difference
difference_set = set1.difference(set2)
print(difference_set)  # Output: {1, 2}
